# Drowsiness-Detection-Using-Mediapipe-Streamlit

A drowsiness detection application created using mediapipe, streamlit and streamlit-webrtc


Libraries used:

1. Mediapipe face mesh: https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_mesh.html
2. Streamlit: https://streamlit.io/
3. streamlit-webrtc: https://github.com/whitphx/streamlit-webrtc

Streamlit cloud app: https://teamneuronsdrowsinessdetection.streamlit.app/

**Note:** As the app is hosted on streamlit, it may happen due to resource limits the app is unavailable. Usually, it resets immediately or within 10-15 mins. So you can give it a go after some buffer time.
